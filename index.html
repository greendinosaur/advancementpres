				<blockquote>A fully remote team is a group of people who work together on a project or product while
					being dispersed across different geographical locations; no team-members are co-located.

				<h4>Research Questions</h4>
				<p>
				<ol class="rq">
					<li>What tools do remote software teams use to collaborate and how do they choose which to use?</li>
					<li>How do remote software teams use tools to collaborate?</li>
					<li>What challenges do they face with their tooling?</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>Research Method</h4>
				<p>Semi-structured interviews by a pair of researchers with 8 participants</p>
				<p>Recruited from researchers' personal networks</p>
				<p>Transcripts reviewed and memo per interview. Collated to identify common themes. Reviewed with a
					second researcher</p>

				<h4><span style="color: #41A0F2">RQ3:</span> What challenges do they face with their tooling?</h4>
				<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Information silos</p>
				<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"><small><q>I’ve been working with Google Drive for quite some
							time now and I still can’t figure out
							sometimes where documents are, where they go and how to find them. So, typically, the best
							way that I find documents that are shared through Google Docs is through my Slack
							notification saying
							someone shared a document with you and I can just go and look exactly for that document,
							click on
							the link and go, rather than searching Google Drive for it.</q></small>

				<h4><span style="color: #41A0F2">RQ3:</span> What challenges do they face with their tooling?</h4>
				<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Information overload</p>
				<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"><small><q>I mean that's kind of my biggest gripe about
							communicating that way is always just having to have Slack open
							and getting notifications for all the messages that I may not necessarily care about at the
							moment when I try to focus on something else.</q></small>
